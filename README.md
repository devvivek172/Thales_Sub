## Features

- **Wind Tunnel:** Simulates airflow in a wind tunnel.
- **High-Resolution Tunnel:** Provides a high-resolution simulation of airflow.
- **Tank:** Demonstrates fluid behavior in a tank with gravity.
- **Paint:** Visualizes the diffusion and advection of a colored dye in the fluid.
- **Toggle Streamlines:** Visualizes streamlines to show the direction of fluid flow.
- **Toggle Velocities:** Displays the velocity vectors of the fluid.
- **Toggle Pressure:** Shows the pressure distribution within the fluid.
- **Toggle Smoke:** Simulates smoke to visualize the fluid flow.
- **Overrelaxation:** An option to speed up the convergence of the pressure solver.
